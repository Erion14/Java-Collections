# Java Collections Framework Learning

This folder contains my work and projects related to learning the Java Collections Framework.

## Overview

The Java Collections Framework provides a set of classes and interfaces to handle and manipulate collections of objects in Java. This includes lists, sets, maps, and other data structures that are essential for various programming tasks.

## Projects

### 1. MyList Implementation

- **File**: `DefaultMyList.java`
- **Description**: This file contains my custom implementation of a simple list interface called `MyList`. It includes basic functionalities such as adding elements, removing elements, clearing the list, and more.

  - **Folder**: `iterator`
    - **File**: `CustomProductIterator.java`
    - **Description**: This file contains my custom iterator implementation, `CustomProductIterator`, designed for iterating through a collection of products.

### 2. List Performance Evaluation

- **File**: `ListPerformanceEvaluation.java`
- **Description**: This file includes a program to evaluate the performance of `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`. It tests various operations such as adding elements to the beginning, middle, and end, as well as removing elements from different positions.

### 3. Custom Product Comparator

- **File**: `CustomProductComparator.java`
- **Description**: This file contains my custom comparator implementation, `CustomProductComparator`, which compares products based on their prices. It's designed for sorting a collection of products based on their price.

### 4. Help Desk System

- **File**: `HelpDesk.java`
- **Description**: Design the back-end system of a Help Desk for an online store using the concepts of queues and dequeues.
